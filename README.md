# ðŸŒ€ Maze Generation  

![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/c-%2300599C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=c&logoColor=white)  

This project implements a maze generation algorithm in `C`. It utilizes the `conio.h` and `windows.h` libraries for rendering the maze in the console.  

Since the project relies on Windows-specific libraries, it requires **MinGW** to compile and run the code.  

- [Download MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/)
